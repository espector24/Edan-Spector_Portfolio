About Edan:

My name is Edan Spector and I'm a fourth year Marine Science student, with a Statistics minor. I'm passionate about life sciences, specifically Marine Mammal conservation and behavioral sciences.

I'm currently a research and Stranding Intern with Moss Landing Marine Laboratory's Vertebrate Ecology Lab, a CRLA certified peer tutor and a full time student as I continue to navigate this thing we call life.
